# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to play in two-player mode with a responsive and interactive interface. The project implemented game logic through JavaScript for win detection, draws, and turn-based moves, while CSS was used to design a clean and user-friendly layout.
